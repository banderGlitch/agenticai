Here is the comprehensive design document for the Tic Tac Toe game project:

**Functional Design**

**1. System Overview**

The Tic Tac Toe game system is a web-based application that allows two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. The system provides an intuitive user interface for players to interact with the game, and it responds to user input in a timely manner. The system determines the winner of the game based on standard Tic Tac Toe rules and displays the winner or a draw if all squares are filled.

**2. User Interfaces**

The system consists of the following screens/pages:

* **Game Board Screen**: A 3x3 grid that displays the game board. Players can take turns marking a square on the grid using a standard keyboard and mouse.
* **Game Over Screen**: Displays the winner of the game or a draw if all squares are filled.
* **New Game Screen**: Allows players to start a new game.

**3. Data Models**

The system uses the following data models:

* **Game**: Represents a single game of Tic Tac Toe. Attributes:
	+ id (unique identifier)
	+ player1 (player 1's mark, either X or O)
	+ player2 (player 2's mark, either X or O)
	+ board (3x3 grid representing the game board)
	+ winner (winner of the game, either player 1, player 2, or draw)
	+ created_at (timestamp when the game was created)
	+ updated_at (timestamp when the game was last updated)
* **Move**: Represents a single move made by a player. Attributes:
	+ id (unique identifier)
	+ game_id (foreign key referencing the Game entity)
	+ player (player who made the move, either player 1 or player 2)
	+ row (row number of the move, 1-3)
	+ col (column number of the move, 1-3)
	+ created_at (timestamp when the move was made)

**4. Business Logic and Workflows**

The system's business logic and workflows are as follows:

* When a player makes a move, the system updates the game board and checks if the game is won or drawn.
* If the game is won or drawn, the system displays the winner or draw on the Game Over Screen.
* If the game is not won or drawn, the system allows the next player to make a move.
* When a player starts a new game, the system creates a new Game entity and initializes the game board.

**5. Integration Points**

The system does not integrate with any external systems or APIs.

**Technical Design**

**1. Architecture Overview**

The system's architecture is a web-based, client-server architecture. The client-side is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it communicates with the server-side using RESTful APIs. The server-side is built using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express) and it uses a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL) to store game data.

**Architecture Diagram:**

```
          +---------------+
          |  Client-side  |
          |  (HTML, CSS,  |
          |   JavaScript)  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Server-side  |
          |  (Web Framework|
          |   with RESTful |
          |   APIs)        |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database     |
          |  (Relational    |
          |   Database     |
          |   Management    |
          |   System)       |
          +---------------+
```

**2. Technology Stack**

* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Back-end: Node.js with Express
* Database: MySQL

**3. Component Design**

The system consists of the following components:

* **GameBoardComponent**: Handles rendering the game board and updating it when a player makes a move.
* **GameLogicComponent**: Handles the game's business logic, including checking if the game is won or drawn.
* **APIGateway**: Handles incoming API requests from the client-side and routes them to the appropriate server-side components.
* **DatabaseAccessComponent**: Handles interactions with the database, including creating, reading, and updating game data.

**4. Database Schema**

The database schema consists of the following tables:

* **games**: Represents a single game of Tic Tac Toe. Columns:
	+ id (primary key)
	+ player1
	+ player2
	+ board
	+ winner
	+ created_at
	+ updated_at
* **moves**: Represents a single move made by a player. Columns:
	+ id (primary key)
	+ game_id (foreign key referencing the games table)
	+ player
	+ row
	+ col
	+ created_at

**5. API Specifications**

The system provides the following APIs:

* **POST /games**: Creates a new game.
* **GET /games/:id**: Retrieves a game by ID.
* **PUT /games/:id**: Updates a game.
* **POST /games/:id/moves**: Makes a new move in a game.

**6. Security Considerations**

The system uses HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client-side and server-side. The system also uses input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**7. Performance Considerations**

The system is designed to handle multiple games simultaneously without significant performance degradation. The system uses caching to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.

**8. Deployment Strategy**

The system will be deployed on a cloud-based platform (e.g., AWS) using a containerization tool (e.g., Docker). The system will be scalable and can be easily updated or rolled back using a CI/CD pipeline.
