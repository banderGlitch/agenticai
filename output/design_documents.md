Here is the comprehensive design document for the Tic Tac Toe game project:

**Functional Design**

### 1. System Overview

The Tic Tac Toe game system is a web-based application that allows two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. The system provides a user-friendly interface for players to make moves, displays the game board, and determines the winner of the game.

### 2. User Interfaces

The system consists of the following user interfaces:

* **Game Board Page**: This is the main page of the application, where players can see the 3x3 game board and make moves. The page displays the current state of the game, including the moves made by each player.
* **New Game Page**: This page allows players to start a new game. It provides a button to start a new game, which resets the game board and allows players to begin a new game.
* **Game Outcome Page**: This page displays the outcome of the game, including the winner (if any) and the final state of the game board.

### 3. Data Models

The system uses the following data models:

* **Game**: Represents a single game of Tic Tac Toe, with attributes:
	+ `id` (unique identifier)
	+ `gameBoard` (3x3 array of squares, each representing a move by a player)
	+ `player1` (player who makes the first move)
	+ `player2` (player who makes the second move)
	+ `winner` (the winner of the game, if any)
* **Move**: Represents a single move made by a player, with attributes:
	+ `id` (unique identifier)
	+ `gameId` (foreign key referencing the Game entity)
	+ `player` (the player who made the move)
	+ `square` (the square on the game board where the move was made)

### 4. Business Logic and Workflows

The system uses the following business logic and workflows:

* **Game Initialization**: When a new game is started, the system initializes a new Game entity and sets up the game board.
* **Move Validation**: When a player makes a move, the system validates the move to ensure it is valid (e.g., not trying to mark a square already occupied). If the move is invalid, the system provides feedback to the player.
* **Game Outcome Determination**: After each move, the system checks if the game is over (i.e., a player has won or all squares are filled and no player has won). If the game is over, the system determines the winner and displays the game outcome.
* **Game Board Update**: After each move, the system updates the game board to reflect the new state of the game.

### 5. Integration Points

The system does not have any external integration points, as it is a self-contained web-based application.

**Technical Design**

### 1. Architecture Overview

The system uses a client-server architecture, with a web-based client (browser) communicating with a server-side application. The server-side application uses a RESTful API to handle requests from the client.

Here is a high-level architecture diagram:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Browser    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  HTTP Requests
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Server     |
          |  (Node.js)  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  RESTful API
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database  |
          |  (MongoDB)  |
          +---------------+
```
### 2. Technology Stack

The system uses the following technologies:

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using React library)
* **Backend**: Node.js (using Express framework)
* **Database**: MongoDB

### 3. Component Design

The system consists of the following components:

* **Game Board Component**: Responsible for rendering the game board and handling user input (moves).
* **Game Logic Component**: Responsible for validating moves, determining game outcomes, and updating the game board.
* **API Component**: Responsible for handling RESTful API requests from the client.
* **Database Component**: Responsible for storing and retrieving game data from the MongoDB database.

### 4. Database Schema

The system uses the following MongoDB schema:

* **games** collection:
	+ `_id` (ObjectId, primary key)
	+ `gameBoard` (array of 3x3 squares)
	+ `player1` (string)
	+ `player2` (string)
	+ `winner` (string)
* **moves** collection:
	+ `_id` (ObjectId, primary key)
	+ `gameId` (ObjectId, foreign key referencing the games collection)
	+ `player` (string)
	+ `square` (integer)

### 5. API Specifications

The system provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

* **POST /games**: Creates a new game and returns the game ID.
* **GET /games/:gameId**: Retrieves the game board for a specific game.
* **POST /games/:gameId/moves**: Makes a move in a specific game and returns the updated game board.
* **GET /games/:gameId/outcome**: Retrieves the outcome of a specific game.

### 6. Security Considerations

The system uses the following security measures:

* **Authentication**: None (the system is a public-facing application and does not require authentication).
* **Authorization**: None (the system does not have any restricted resources or actions).
* **Data Encryption**: None (the system does not store sensitive data).

### 7. Performance Considerations

The system is designed to handle a high volume of requests and responses. The following performance considerations are in place:

* **Caching**: The system uses caching to reduce the load on the database and improve response times.
* **Load Balancing**: The system uses load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
* **Optimized Database Queries**: The system uses optimized database queries to reduce the load on the database.

### 8. Deployment Strategy

The system will be deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS) using a containerization platform (e.g., Docker). The deployment strategy includes:

* **Continuous Integration**: The system uses continuous integration to automate testing and deployment.
* **Continuous Deployment**: The system uses continuous deployment to automate deployment to production.
* **Monitoring and Logging**: The system uses monitoring and logging tools to track performance and identify issues.
