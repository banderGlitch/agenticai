Here is a deployment plan and configuration for the Tic Tac Toe game project:

**Deployment Strategy**

Recommended deployment approach: Containerization using Docker and Kubernetes

Environment setup:

* Dev: Local development environment with Docker Compose
* Staging: Staging environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) using Kubernetes
* Production: Production environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) using Kubernetes

CI/CD pipeline configuration:

* Use GitHub Actions or CircleCI to automate builds, tests, and deployments
* Configure pipeline to deploy to staging environment on push to master branch
* Configure pipeline to deploy to production environment on manual approval

**Infrastructure as Code**

Docker configuration ( Dockerfile ):

```
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Kubernetes manifests ( deployment.yaml ):

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tic-tac-toe
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: tic-tac-toe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: tic-tac-toe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tic-tac-toe
        image: <docker-image-name>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

Service manifest ( service.yaml ):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tic-tac-toe
spec:
  selector:
    app: tic-tac-toe
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**Deployment Instructions**

Step-by-step deployment guide:

1. Create a Docker image by running `docker build -t <docker-image-name> .` in the project root
2. Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub)
3. Create a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP)
4. Apply the Kubernetes manifests using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` and `kubectl apply -f service.yaml`
5. Verify the deployment by accessing the game at `http://<load-balancer-ip>:80`

Required environment variables:

* `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
* `NODE_ENV`: Environment variable (dev, staging, production)

Database migration steps:

* Create a MongoDB instance on a cloud provider (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
* Configure the MongoDB connection string in the environment variables

Rollback procedures:

* Use Kubernetes rolling updates to roll back to a previous version of the application
* Use Docker image tags to roll back to a previous version of the Docker image

**Monitoring and Logging Setup**

Recommended monitoring tools:

* Prometheus for metrics
* Grafana for visualization
* New Relic for application performance monitoring

Log aggregation configuration:

* Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and analysis
* Configure Logstash to collect logs from the application

Alert setup recommendations:

* Set up alerts for application errors and performance issues using New Relic
* Set up alerts for infrastructure issues using Prometheus and Grafana
