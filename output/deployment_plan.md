Here is a comprehensive deployment plan and configuration for the Snake Game project:

**Deployment Strategy**

Recommended deployment approach: Containerization using Docker and Kubernetes

Environment setup:

* Dev: Local development environment with Docker Compose
* Staging: Staging environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) with Kubernetes
* Production: Production environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) with Kubernetes

CI/CD pipeline configuration:

* GitHub Actions or CircleCI for automated testing, building, and deployment
* Docker Hub for container registry
* Kubernetes for orchestration and deployment

**Infrastructure as Code**

Docker configuration:

* `Dockerfile` for building the Snake Game image
* `docker-compose.yml` for local development environment

Kubernetes manifests:

* `deployment.yaml` for deploying the Snake Game application
* `service.yaml` for exposing the Snake Game service
* `ingress.yaml` for configuring ingress traffic

Terraform template:

* `main.tf` for provisioning infrastructure on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP)

Serverless configuration:

* Not applicable for this project, as it requires a persistent game state and real-time updates.

**Deployment Instructions**

Step-by-step deployment guide:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the local development environment.
3. Make changes to the code and test locally.
4. Push changes to the remote repository.
5. Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy the application to the staging environment.
6. Verify the application in the staging environment.
7. Promote the application to the production environment.

Required environment variables:

* `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
* `NODE_ENV`: Environment variable (dev, staging, production)

Database migration steps:

* Run `npm run migrate` to migrate the database schema.

Rollback procedures:

* Roll back to a previous deployment by updating the `deployment.yaml` file with the previous image tag.
* Run `kubectl rollout undo deployment/snake-game` to roll back to the previous deployment.

**Monitoring and Logging Setup**

Recommended monitoring tools:

* Prometheus for metrics and alerting
* Grafana for visualization and dashboarding

Log aggregation configuration:

* ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and analysis

Alert setup recommendations:

* Set up alerts for high CPU usage, memory usage, and error rates.
* Configure alerting for database connection issues and slow queries.

**Configuration Files and Scripts**

Here are the necessary configuration files and scripts for deployment:

**Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "server/app.js"]
```
**docker-compose.yml**
```yaml

  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.snake-game.id]
  key_name               = "snake-game"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      host        = self.public_ip
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("~/.ssh/snake-game")
    }

    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y docker.io",
      "sudo systemctl start docker",
      "sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 <docker-hub-username>/snake-game:latest"
    ]

  description = "Allow inbound traffic on port 3000"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 3000
    to_port     = 3000
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```
Note: This is a basic deployment plan and configuration, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you should ensure that you have the necessary credentials and permissions to deploy to your chosen cloud provider.
